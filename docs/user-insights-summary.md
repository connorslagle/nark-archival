## Success Factors

1. **Ease of Use**: Must be simpler than current tools
2. **Network Effects**: Value increases with users
3. **Quality Control**: Maintain academic standards
4. **Incentive Alignment**: Everyone benefits
5. **Gradual Migration**: Work with existing systems

## Risks to Address

1. **Quality Concerns**: Need strong peer review
2. **Adoption Barriers**: Tenure committees
3. **Technical Complexity**: Keep it simple
4. **Spam/Gaming**: Robust policies needed
5. **Sustainability**: Long-term funding model

## Next Steps

1. Implement new event types
2. Build reputation system MVP
3. Create user-specific clients
4. Develop mobile apps
5. Establish partnerships

The user analysis reveals that NARK must be more than just a decentralized archive - it needs to be a complete academic ecosystem that serves all stakeholders better than the current system.
